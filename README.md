## Inspiration

Open Government Data has been getting more popular in the last few years. But in many cases, its just huge tables to scroll through or even worse some convoluted APIs to call from which ordinary people won’t ever be able to benefit.

This is why we developed AskOpenData.

## What it does

It’s 3 main goals are to allow ordinary users to discover OGD and through good visualizations, understand the underlying facts. At the same time, we want the data and visualizations to be correct and trusted.

A user can search for data visualizations with a Natural Language Input and view them. They can also share the visualizations in the form of a poster which is identical to the ones used in a fictitious ad-campaign we designed to make AskOpenData known to the public.
